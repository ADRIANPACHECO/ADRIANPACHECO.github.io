A Capstone project may be a brand new project, an extension of a project begun in another course, or an extension of a faculty research project. Students are encouraged to work in teams of their choosing; however, individual projects are also fine.</p>

                <p style="color: #222">Among cities in the United States, Seattle is home to a comparatively large number of reported crimes.  Many people don’t feel as safe as they should when travelling on foot (particularly alone or at night).Being college students in the greater Seattle area, we’ve had our fair share of walking and using public transportation to get around.</p>

            <div class="col-md-3">
                <p style="color: #222">Occasionally, we’ll receive a UW Police Alert or see a post garnering some attention on a campus Facebook group to let us know of some areas to be cautious of, but those alerts may be forgotten after a few hours. Sometimes these alerts aren’t pushed to users until a few days after the incident has already occurred. </p>

Student life goes beyond these time slots and locations, and personal safety is a top priority for many students.  </p>

            <p style="color: #222">Barry is a hopeful electrical engineering student at the University of Washington, who currently lives off campus in the Fremont neighborhood. He relies heavily on public transportation and walking to commute because he cares about his greenhouse gas emissions and doesn’t like cars. He spends a lot of time on campus because he is heavily involved with three organizations, and often spends his free time working on projects.</p>

He normally takes the NightRide after 8pm, but service hasn’t begun yet and it is already dark out. Barry isn’t feeling the best about his safety once he departs the main campus area. He wants to ensure he’ll get home safely while carrying his item from the Ave..</p>

            <p style="color: #222">Tulio first began vlogging his travels after he documented his studies in his own homeland of Brazil. He plans on travelling all across the U.S. in the next couple of months and has just recently invested in new vlogging equipment in preparation. He always carries his camera with him, but has recently felt wary about his security after his last vlog went viral and more people have begun recognizing him internationally. He loves meeting new people and can often be found chatting up locals in craft breweries and engaging with people in popular tourist spots. He prefers taking public transportation and walking, rather than Uber or driving, because he likes to engage with other people and feels like he’s able to experience the city better on public transport.</p>

            <p style="color: #222">Tulio has just arrived in Seattle. Excited to explore all that Seattle has to offer, he’s heard a lot about the increasing violence in some parts of town due to gentrification and tensions among cultural groups. He already has a few locations in mind he wants to visit, but is hoping to meet a few locals who can show him the lesser known gems of Seattle. The whole time he’ll be in in town, he’ll have his camera equipment on him. Tulio definitely wants to avoid secluded areas so he can feel safer in the public eye.</p>
