Some participants were also briefly interviewed afterward to elaborate on some of their responses. </p><br>
                <p class="spacing">We wanted to know more about how our users perceived their safety living in Seattle and to learn more about what current devices or strategies they used to protect themselves while commuting.  We had 50 individuals respond to the survey, 90% of which were in the age range of 19-24 and 10% in the age range of 13-18. A combination of quantitative and qualitative questions were asked. After coding and analyzing our results, we came up with the following conclusions that validated and provided insight for some of our initial assumptions: </p>

                        <p class="spacing ">This was an assumption that our team initially made at the start of our project and were not surprised by the nearly unanimous response set we received after asking our users to describe what circumstances they felt less/safer. Several participants also commented feeling safer when they were walking with a male friend. If we have the time and resources, our team may consider adding additional support or features specific to female users. Some interviewed participants also commented that they consciously made an effort not to use their phone or take it out of their pockets while walking (for fear of becoming an easy target for robbery or assault). </p>

Interviewing our participants about UW Alerts validated some of our previous assumptions about their frustrations with the current system. Many participants mentioned only receiving ‘vague’ statements from UWPD hours or days after incidents, or not receiving alerts at all about “smaller” incidents like assault, robbery, or petty theft. None of our participants responded hearing about an incident as it was happening, and only 16% said they heard about it minutes after. Despite this, many of our interviewed participants expressed a desire for knowing this information in real-time.

                            <p class="spacing">We decided to follow a similar concept by having a map view be the first thing a user sees when the Safely app opens.

Eventually, user testing results showed that people would much rather prefer using Google and Apple Maps to get to their destination. </p> <br>
                 <p class="spacing">So we simplified the turn-by-turn navigational system by giving users the ability to set an end destination that displays routes with varying safety ranges in an aerial map view. Once a route is selected, the aerial map view remains and follows the user's current location until they safely reach their destination. This gives users the freedom to use their preferred navigational app while Safely becomes more of a precautionary step to take in foreseeing danger before starting a trip. </p>

Originally, we designed Safely to work in a way that gives users the ability to inform others only at the moment an incident occurs. Problem is, that is not always the case.  <br><br>In reality, at the time of an emergency situation, users will prioritize their personal safety over the safety of others. They will not take the time to pause during a high concentrated situation to inform others but will rather do so at a time when they feel safe. With that in mind, we redesigned the way users contribute to the Safely app by giving them the ability to quickly drop a marker (location of incident) during their route which can then be given more detail once they have safely reached their destination.</p>

                <p class="titlebold">THE PROCESS </p><p class="spacing">I started the UI design process by creating wireframes in AdobeXD that demonstrated an adopted Snapchat-like information architecture that we were able to work from as an evolving UI. We then began to dedicate each screen to represent feature capabilities that included, 1) crowdsourced/SPD incident markers plotted on a map, 2) a search route menu, 3) a timeline feed of nearby incidents, 4) suggested route overview, 5) en-route display. </p><br> <p class="spacing">Once we defined core user functionalities, it then became my responsibility to simplify, design, and iterate each feature through user testing until results showed measures of intuitive interactions when dealing with the data (incident markers/thermal map) and when fewer questions were asked during prototype testing. Because of time constraints, early design considerations that enabled users to get in touch with emergency contacts and authorities were dropped, allowing our developers to focus on geofencing alerts and notifications. </p>
                <br>
              <p class="spacing">The challenge in creating a usable and visually appealing interface was to make our collected data understandable at a glance. I followed minimal design principles to create an interface that emphasized the data and its source by utilizing color, iconography, button placement, and user status.  </p>

                <p class="spacing">A critical part of designing the user interface over an iterative process was to ensure that it was usable while designing to keep it minimal. I understood that visual communication can be broken up into three organizational attributes that demonstrate relationships among elements, in this case, UI elements.  </p><br>
                <p class="spacing"><span class="spacing">HIERARCHY =</span> a dominant-subordinate relationship among elements</p>

                <p class="spacing">With this in mind, I decided to create a grayscale prototype for usability testing in order to discover if the position, size, shape, orientation, alignment, and proximity of UI elements spoke for themselves as actionable items. With the removal of color, I was able to observe how users interacted with the UI's information architecture. Learning about what areas needed user experience improvement helped create a smooth transition into designing a high-fidelity prototype that emphasized color as dominate element of hierarchy. </p></div>

This type of emotional design is what motivated me to take on the role as the UI designer from the start of the project. I wanted to challenge myself to create a quality experience that looked and felt easy to use for first-time users by emphasizing concepts of minimalism. Successfully doing so would highlight the importance of Safely's data and core functionalities.</p><br>
                <p class="spacing"><span>BEHAVIORAL EMOTIONAL DESIGN</span><br>As much as I wanted to design a visually appealing app, I also knew it was important to create a functional user experience. At the core, Safely is designed to protect people from unsafe situations with real-time crime data, meaning that it was important to establish a sense of security during initial interactions. Having that as a key concept allowed me to really evaluate how well and intuitive each functionality performs before transferring my designs over to our developers.  </p> <br>
                <p class="spacing"><span>REFLECTIVE EMOTIONAL DESIGN</span><br>At the end of the day, reflective emotional design is what matters the most to Safely (and to most digital solutions). Once users find that our product has the potential to make an impact on their lives, we hope it keeps them coming back for more because it holds intrinsic value. Although it was critical to design our Safely app to look appealing and be usable, no value would be given to our product if users did not feel the need to use it for their protection.
