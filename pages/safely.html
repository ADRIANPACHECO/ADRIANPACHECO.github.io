Some participants were also briefly interviewed afterward to elaborate on some of their responses. </p><br>
                <p class="spacing">We wanted to know more about how our users perceived their safety living in Seattle and to learn more about what current devices or strategies they used to protect themselves while commuting.

                        <p class="spacing">When asked “What does safety mean to you?” we received very similar responses related to the users’ desire to be physically out of harm’s way and also having peace of mind and not having to worry about being harmed, targeted, or assaulted.

We discovered that each of their primary function is presented to users almost immediately after the app opens, giving users an instant call to action. We decided to follow a similar concept by having a map view be the first thing a user sees when the Safely app opens. </p>

This simply acts as a high-level neighborhood watch where a single user can make a social impact to the Seattle community. </p>

Eventually, user testing results showed that people would much rather use Google and Apple Maps to get to their destination. Our simplified aerial map view gives users the freedom to use their preferred navigational app while Safely becomes more of a precautionary step to take in foreseeing danger before starting a trip.</p>

                <p class="spacing">Safely users are informed in real-time through push notifications when a crime is posted nearby or in areas along a route. As a primary feature of the Safely app, those who use it can submit an incident to warn others about a dangerous situation or disturbance they have observed or experienced. Submitted incidents are tagged and saved for 72 hours as an interactive marker on the map that specifies the type of crime encountered along with a detailed description. </p>

                <p class="spacing">Informational interview results gave us reason to rethink our approach on how users inform the Safely community, especially during emergency situations. Originally, we designed Safely to work in a way that gives users the ability to inform others only at the moment an incident occurs. Problem is, that is not always the case.  At the time of an emergency situation, users will prioritize their personal safety over the safety of others. So we designed Safely to give users the ability to quickly drop a marker (location of incident) during their route which can then be given more detail once they have safely reached their destination.</p>

Once users find that our product has the potential to make an impact on their lives, we hope it keeps them coming back for more because it holds intrinsic value. Although it was critical to design our Safely app to look appealing and be usable, no value would be given to our product if users did not feel the need to use it for their protection.
