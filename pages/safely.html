                    <p class="spacing" style="text-align: justify">We designed and sent out a Google survey to various family, friends, and coworkers via convenience sampling to gain a better understanding of our users’ safety habits. Some participants were also briefly interviewed afterward to elaborate on some of their responses. We wanted to know more about how our users perceived their safety living in Seattle and to learn more about what current devices or strategies they used to protect themselves while commuting. After coding and analyzing our results, we came up with the following conclusions that validated and provided insight for some of our initial assumptions: </p>

Several participants also commented feeling safer when they were walking with a male friend while others commented that they consciously made an effort not to use their phone or take it out of their pockets while walking. </p></div>

                        <p class="spacing" style="text-align: justify">When asked “What does safety mean to you?” we received very similar responses related to the users’ desire to be physically out of harm’s way and also having peace of mind and not having to worry about being harmed, targeted, or assaulted. Users used phrases like “feeling confident, not worried”, “not having to question my personal well-being”, “absence of fear”, and “not having to worry about being harmed”.  </p>

None of our participants responded hearing about an incident as it was happening, and only 16.4% said they heard about it minutes after.

                        <p class="spacing" style="text-align: justify">During the early stages of brainstorming and ideation, we spent some time understanding what makes apps like Uber and Google Maps easy to use and navigate for first time users. We discovered that each of their primary function is accessible to users almost immediately after the app opens, giving users an instant call to action. We decided to follow a similar concept by having a map view be the first thing a user sees when the Safely app opens. </p>
